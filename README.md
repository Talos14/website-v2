# website-v2
Dumped 2 months of dev into my first website, scrapped it all over a font mismatch, here we go again.

Note: This website is nowhere close to being finished, this is merely the first version that i can publicly show to the world without burying my head 5 feet deep in the soil from the shame. Be brutal guys, for everyone that sees it, post feedback via email. Would absolutely LOVE it if you guys had any feedback for it.
